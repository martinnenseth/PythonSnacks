#In this exercise, the task is to write a function that picks a random word from a list of words from the SOWPODS dictionary. Download this file and save it in the same directory as your Python code. This file is Peter Norvigâ€™s compilation of the dictionary of words used in professional Scrabble tournaments. Each line in the file contains a single word.

# simple solution: append to array. Better: randomly pop a line from the file without temporarily storing it.
def pick_word():
    lines = []
    with open("sowpods.txt", "r") as file:
        for line in file:
            lines.append(str(line))

        return random.choice(lines)


def guess():
    word = pick_word().lower()
    print(word)
    wrong_guesses = []
    correct_guess = "_" * len(word)
    correct_guess = list(correct_guess)

    while len(word) >= 0:
        letter = input("Guess your letter: ")
        if letter not in word:
            print("Incorrect!")
            wrong_guesses.append(letter)
            continue
        else:
            print("Correct!")
            index = word.index(letter)
            correct_guess[index] = letter
            print(correct_guess)


# TODO: Check if there are several indexes of letter in word. The word is an element too long atm.


def main():
    print("Welcome to Hangman!")
    print("- - - - - - -")
